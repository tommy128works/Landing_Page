# Landing_Page

This cat themed landing page was created as a learning exercise for CSS Flexbox. This page is not intended to be viewed on mobile. Future improvements include using a color theme and text content more fit for cat theme.

This is a guided project by The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/)
